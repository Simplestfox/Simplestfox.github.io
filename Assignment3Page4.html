		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>
		I am currently working full time and going to college. my dream is to become a .net developer or a full stack developer one day. I want to continue my education at college and eventually attend a coding camp to expand my knowledge. I would love to design a website and continue to update it as I learn and progress with my knowledge as a developer.
		</p>
		<p>
		I think I have large array of experience and I hope to use that as I become a developer. I have worked in Customer Service for many years and I believe that has increased my knowledge to working with others and collaborating with teams and customers. I have worked in a Service Desks environment and worked with users daily in the programs they use on a day to day basis and seen what is expected and what is unexpected from the users end prospective/ I have also worked within an DevOps environment where I would work as a team and maintain our deployment tool environment and do nightly and weekend releases and have a understanding of the importance of separation of duties and the time involvement behind deployment windows. I am hoping to leverage my knowledge to assist me in becoming a better developer as I learn.
